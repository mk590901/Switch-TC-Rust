# Switch-TC-Rust

The application tests threaded code generated by the editor of hierarchical state machines. The original scheme can be seen on the __switch_reset.svg__ attached to the project. It's model of a switch affected by two events: __TURN__ and __RESET__. The first switches two states __ON__ and __OFF__, the second resets the state machine to the __OFF__ state regardless of what state it was in before.

## Precondition

The editor's __Planner__ module was supplemented with __Rust__ code generator, which automatically create the __switch_reset_helper.rs__ file with the transfer functions. This file also contain function __create_helper__ builds QHsmHelper structure for processing these functions. A core has also been added to the application, which services the launch of threaded code and the impact of events on it. This is a set of several very simple structures placed to the __core.rs__ file: __EventWrapper__, which describes and keep an event, __QHsmHelper__ with the __IQHsmStateMachineHelper__ interface, which contains a container of threaded codes and ensures its execution under the influence of events, __ThreadedCodeExecutor__ - a structure ensures the launch of threaded code for a specific state and event.
